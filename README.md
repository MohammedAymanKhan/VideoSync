## About

VideoSync is a real-time video synchronization platform that lets you watch videos with others, with all interactionsâ€”like play, pause, and skipâ€”perfectly synced across everyone in the room. It also includes a chat feature so you can discuss whatâ€™s on screen as it happens. Whether youâ€™re hosting a movie night, sharing a family video, or studying with classmates, VideoSync makes it feel like youâ€™re all together, no matter the distance.

## Problem Solved

Have you ever wanted to watch a pre-recorded videoâ€”like a movie, a family memory, or a study sessionâ€”with friends or family far away, as if it were live? Normally, youâ€™d struggle to keep everyone in sync, with awkward pauses or mismatched timing ruining the experience. VideoSync fixes this by syncing every second of the video for all users in real-time, complete with a chat feature to talk about it as you watchâ€”whether itâ€™s a private group or a public event anyone can join.

---

## Features

- **Upload & Schedule:** Upload a video, set a date and time, and choose if itâ€™s public or private.
- **Public or Private Access:**
  - *Public:* Anyone can request to join, pending host approval.
  - *Private:* Only invited users can participate.
- **Invite Users:** Search for people by name or email and send them invites to your video room.
- **Synchronized Watching:** Everyone sees the same moment of the videoâ€”play, pause, or skip, and it updates for all in real-time.
- **Real-Time Chat:** Chat with everyone in the room, keeping discussions tied to whatâ€™s on screen.
